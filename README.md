# password-extracter
password-extracter is a python based chrome browser password extracter.

# How to Run
- Make sure you have Python installed
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- For client go to client folder and run main.py file, (make sure your chrome browser is close if it is open it will not work) after that it will create a Data.txt file which will be ciphered.
- After getting the Data.txt file go to the server file and and run the decrypter.py with the command line argument the cipherd file(decrypter.py Data.txt) it will genrate the decrypted version of file whcih will store all the chrome passwords and history

# Whats Special ?
After the chrome version 70 it is not possible to decrypt password but with some research and exprience it can be brute forced as I did .
